## üöÄ About

This personal portfolio is a showcase of my skills and projects as a Fullstack Developer with two years of experience. It's built with a powerful trio: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## üõ† Development

I'm currently using `pnpm` as my package manager, but you're free to use your preferred option.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies using `pnpm i`
3. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`

üîó [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) will be your local development environment.

Note: This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to auto-optimize and serve the Inter font from Google Fonts.
